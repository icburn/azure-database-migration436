I had many issues getting the VM up and running.  It turns out that this is because I had not selected a powerful enough machine.  WHen i created a new, more powerful VM, I was able to install SQL server and SSMS, then restore the database.  
I then managed to use up all my Azure credit overnight somehow.  This is when i was told i needed to request a link from AI Core and use that account, so i had to re-do everything on this new account.  It went fairly smoothly and i was eventually able to migrate successfully.  
Next, I backed up the database on the VM.  I then created an azure storage account and then added a new container to it. I uploaded the backup to this container.  Next i created a new VM to be a development 'sandbox'.  I installed SQL serverland SSMS.  Next i donwnloaded the database from the storage containewr and restored it to the server on the sandbox.  Next i created a backup in this new server and then i set up a Management Task that automates weekly backups of the  database.
Emphasize the meticulous backup process, the secure storage achieved through Azure Blob Storage, the seamless restoration onto the development environment, and the execution of automated backups via Maintenance Plans in SSMS.
Next, to simulate data loss, i deleted the top 100 rows from the password table in the person schena.  I then proceeded to restore the database from the azure sql database backup.
