I had many issues getting the VM up and running.  It turns out that this is because I had not selected a powerful enough machine.  WHen i created a new, more powerful VM, I was able to install SQL server and SSMS, then restore the database.  
I then managed to use up all my Azure credit overnight somehow.  This is when i was told i needed to request a link from AI Core and use that account, so i had to re-do everything on this new account.  It went fairly smoothly and i was eventually able to migrate successfully.  
Next, I backed up the database on the VM.  I then created an azure storage account and then added a new container to it. I uploaded the backup to this container.  Next i created a new VM to be a development 'sandbox'.  I installed SQL serverland SSMS.  Next i donwnloaded the database from the storage containewr and restored it to the server on the sandbox.  Next i created a backup in this new server and then i set up a Management Task that automates weekly backups of the  database.
Emphasize the meticulous backup process, the secure storage achieved through Azure Blob Storage, the seamless restoration onto the development environment, and the execution of automated backups via Maintenance Plans in SSMS.
Next, to simulate data loss, i deleted the top 100 rows from the password table in the person schena.  I then proceeded to restore the database from the azure sql database backup.  
Next, to ensure data protection and redundancy, geo-replication was setup for the production database.  I chose to host this replication in Nothern Europe.
Next I orchestrated a planned failover to this secondary region.  I did this by selecting navigating to the production database and nevigating to replicas.  Here, i selected the secondary database and then selected failover.  I then connected to the database on this server using Azure data studio, to verify the contents and check the data.  Once I was satisfied that the failover had worked, I performed a failover back to the primary region.
Next, I set up a new Microsoft Entra ID account for myself, which involved setting up microsoft authenticator as well.  I then set this account to be the microsoft entera admin for the server the production database was on.  Finally, I connected to the Adventureworks database on this server from Azure data studio, using microsoft entera authentication.
Finally, I created a new entera ID, to function as a DB reader.  I then connected to the database using this user, and ran some queries to verify that it had worked.
