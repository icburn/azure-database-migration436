I had many issues getting the VM up and running.  It turns out that this is because I had not selected a powerful enough machine.  WHen i created a new, more powerful VM, I was able to install SQL server and SSMS, then restore the database.  
I then managed to use up all my Azure credit overnight somehow.  This is when i was told i needed to request a link from AI Core and use that account, so i had to re-do everything on this new account.  It went fairly smoothly and i was eventually able to migrate successfully.
